    This operation puts a data record into an Amazon Kinesis
    stream from a producer. This operation must be called to send
    data from the producer into the Amazon Kinesis stream for
    real-time ingestion and subsequent processing. The `PutRecord`
    operation requires the name of the stream that captures,
    stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data
    blob itself. The data blob could be a segment from a log file,
    geographic/location data, website clickstream data, or any
    other data type.

    The partition key is used to distribute data across shards.
    Amazon Kinesis segregates the data records that belong to a
    data stream into multiple shards, using the partition key
    associated with each data record to determine which shard a
    given data record belongs to.

    Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length
    limit of 256 bytes. An MD5 hash function is used to map
    partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated
    data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the
    shards. You can override hashing the partition key to
    determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value
    using the `ExplicitHashKey` parameter. For more information,
    see the `Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide`_.

    `PutRecord` returns the shard ID of where the data record was
    placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data
    record.

    Sequence numbers generally increase over time. To guarantee
    strictly increasing ordering, use the
    `SequenceNumberForOrdering` parameter. For more information,
    see the `Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide`_.

    If a `PutRecord` request cannot be processed because of
    insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in
    the request, `PutRecord` throws
    `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`.

    Data records are accessible for only 24 hours from the time
    that they are added to an Amazon Kinesis stream.

    :type stream_name: string
    :param stream_name: The name of the stream to put the data record into.

    :type data: blob
    :param data: The data blob to put into the record, which is
        Base64-encoded when the blob is serialized.
        The maximum size of the data blob (the payload after
        Base64-decoding) is 50 kilobytes (KB)
        Set `b64_encode` to disable automatic Base64 encoding.

    :type partition_key: string
    :param partition_key: Determines which shard in the stream the data
        record is assigned to. Partition keys are Unicode strings with a
        maximum length limit of 256 bytes. Amazon Kinesis uses the
        partition key as input to a hash function that maps the partition
        key and associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5
        hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer
        values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of
        this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition
        key will map to the same shard within the stream.

    :type explicit_hash_key: string
    :param explicit_hash_key: The hash value used to explicitly determine
        the shard the data record is assigned to by overriding the
        partition key hash.

    :type sequence_number_for_ordering: string
    :param sequence_number_for_ordering: Guarantees strictly increasing
        sequence numbers, for puts from the same client and to the same
        partition key. Usage: set the `SequenceNumberForOrdering` of record
        n to the sequence number of record n-1 (as returned in the
        PutRecordResult when putting record n-1 ). If this parameter is not
        set, records will be coarsely ordered based on arrival time.

    :type b64_encode: boolean
    :param b64_encode: Whether to Base64 encode `data`. Can be set to
        ``False`` if `data` is already encoded to prevent double encoding.
